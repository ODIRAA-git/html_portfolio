<h1>About Me (FULLSTACK DEVELOPER)</h1>
<h2>My Career Journey</h2>

<p>
  I started my career journey in the field of Information Technology as an IT
  Support Specialist.<br />
  I did whilst pursuing a masters degree in Communication Systems and
  Networks.<br />I also had a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Computer
  Engineering.<br />
  There I majored in Telecommunication.<br />
  As a computer Engineering student, I was tutored to be efficient in both
  Networking and Software programming roles.<br />
  This is to say that I have ample networking and programming experience (refer
  to my CV please!)<br />I decided to switch to Software Development as it
  aligns much better as my strong suite in IT.<br />The gap in my work
  experience is due to the fact that I took some time off to raise a family.
